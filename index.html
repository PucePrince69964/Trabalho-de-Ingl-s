        <h1 class="h-titulo">HISTORY</h1>
        <div class="h-texto">The protagonist is a 15-year-old teenager who enters Hogwarts late, entering his fifth 
            year. He competes against Ranrock, a dark goblin, to obtain the repository of ancient magic. To 
            do so, he goes through four trials, each of which gives him an artifact containing memories 
            that tell the story of a witch named Isidora Morganach, who, like the protagonist, is able to see 
            traces of ancient magic. With this, Isidora has access to a magic that removes people's 
            emotions. She uses this magic on her family and students at Hogwarts and stores this magic in 
            repositories. Four teachers who also have the ability to see this magic, called "guardians," use 
            the curse of death, Avada Kedavra, on Isidora to stop her. The four guardians use a magic to 
            erase memories, Obliviate, on the only being who knows of Isidora's activities, which is an 
            goblin named Bragbor. However, Bragbor writes journals with all the information he knows 
            about what happened, and thanks to them, Ranrock finds out about the repositories and is 
            able to find them. Ranrock has all the repositories and is looking for the last one. Upon 
            discovering the location of the last repository, the protagonist and his mentor, Professor Fig, 
            both go after it before Ranrock can reach them. Before they go, the guardians warn the 
            protagonist that he will be tempted to unleash and use the repository's ancient magic, just as 
            Isidora was years before. Upon reaching the protagonist and his mentor, Ranrock reveals that 
            he possesses the wand of Miriam, Professor Fig's wife and a witch who discovers Ronrock's 
            activities but is killed by him when she tries to stop him. Soon the battle between them begins. 
            In the middle of the battle, Ranrock uses magic to counter the protagonist's attack and ends up 
            hitting the repository. As a result, the repository is destroyed and Ranrock absorbs its power, 
            turning into a dragon. 
        </div>
        <h1 class="end-titulo">ENDINGS</h1>
        <div class="end-1"><b>1° -</b>The game has three possible endings, which happen according to the player's choices.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="end-2"><b>2° -</b>In the first ending, still during the battle against Ranrock, the protagonist gives in to 
            temptation and absorbs the ancestral magic from the repository. He uses this magic to kill 
            Ranrock and, after that, he absorbs all the rest of the ancestral magic. The protagonist, in the 
            end, becomes a dark witch and a possible great threat to the witch world. 
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="end-3"><b>3° -</b>In the second ending, also during the battle, the protagonist manages to resist the 
            temptation and chooses to keep the existence of the ancestral magic a secret. After killing 
            Ranrock, the protagonist, with the help of the wounded Professor Fig, manages to seal the 
            ancestral magic again. The professor, in the end, is unable to resist and dies before the 
            protagonist. The protagonist then becomes the new guardian of the ancient magic.

        <h1 class="ch-h">HOGWARTS HOUSES</h1>
        <p1 class="ch-p">
            Upon arrival at Hogwarts, the protagonist is selected for his house by the Sorting Hat. 
            The houses at Hogwarts that he can be selected to are four, being Gryffindor, Slytherin, 
            Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. You can choose which house your character goes to just by 
            selecting the alternative that contains the main characteristic of the desired house. 
            Gryffindor's main characteristic is boldness, Ravenclaw's is curiosity, Hufflepuff's is loyalty, and 
            Slytherin's is ambition.
